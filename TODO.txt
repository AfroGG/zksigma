Stuff to do:
 - generelize proofs that use zkCurve G and H to use whatever is passed into them?
 - make the audtiing functionality abstract, currently it is hardcoded just for sum audits
 - REALLY LONG TERM: 
    - for the auditRep, replace sum and eProof with []*bigInt for multiple returns
    - same for the eProof, replace it with []*Proofs
    - this would mean all proofs have to be derived from a "parent" proof class... 

NEW STUFF:
- Make the init take in any curve
- generalize the curve to be passed into each function

Merlin code abstraction from Rust-Bulletproof guys

Next steps:
- Make APL work with this
- Optimizations to zkSigma
