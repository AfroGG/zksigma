Stuff to do:

 - Make sure that all the Challenge's had a Mod operation applied to then...
 - Add in Base-Result checks to EquivORLogProof
 - Check what is redundant and see what functions can be deleted
 - EquivilanceOrLog Verify function and test function on hold, not critical
 - add true and false flags to all proof gens incase of proof gen failure
 - all values should be modValue
 - generelize proofs that use zkCurve G and H to use whatever is passed into them?


NOTES: 
- EquivilanceOrLog is not used but built it anyways 
- VerifyZeroSumCommitments is not necessary anymore, removed it comepletely
-
