Stuff to do:

 - Start EquivilanceOrLog
 - Figure out purpose of VerifyZeroSumCommitments()
 - Can EquivORLogProof be written as a super-proof of EquivProof?
 - Figure out purpose of ProveEquivalenceORLog()? Its not used anywhere...
 - Make sure that all the Challenge's had a Mod operation applied to then...
 - Does s also need to be Mod N?

 - Check what is redundant and see what functions can be deleted
