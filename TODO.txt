Stuff to do:

 - Make sure that all the Challenge's had a Mod operation applied to then...
 - Does s also need to be Mod N?
 - Add in Base-Result checks to EquivORLogProof
 - Check what is redundant and see what functions can be deleted
 - EquivilanceOrLog Verify function and test function on hold, not critical


NOTES: 
- EquivilanceOrLog is not used but built it anyways 
- VerifyZeroSumCommitments is not necessary anymore, removed it comepletely
-
