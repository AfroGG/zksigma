Stuff to do:
 - generelize proofs that use zkCurve G and H to use whatever is passed into them?
 - make the audtiing functionality abstract, currently it is hardcoded just for sum audits
 - REALLY LONG TERM: 
    - for the auditRep, replace sum and eProof with []*bigInt for multiple returns
    - same for the eProof, replace it with []*Proofs
    - this would mean all proofs have to be derived from a "parent" proof class... 

NEW STUFF:
- Check if I am overwriting any values that need to be maintianed
- Errors instead of bools
- Make the init take in any curve
- check if link fits elliptic.curve interface 
- EITHER REMOVE OR TEST sEquivilanceOrLog Verify function and test function on hold, not critical
- goDoc format for crypto notes
- browser goDocs
