Stuff to do:

 - Add in Base-Result checks to EquivORLogProof
 - EquivilanceOrLog Verify function and test function on hold, not critical
 - generelize proofs that use zkCurve G and H to use whatever is passed into them?
 - add in range proofs to crpyto.go? 
 - more consistant error and fatalf messages 
 - make the audtiing functionality abstract, currently it is hardcoded just for sum audits
 - REALLY LONG TERM: 
    - for the auditRep, replace sum and eProof with []*bigInt for multiple returns
    - same for the eProof, replace it with []*Proofs
    - this would mean all proofs have to be derived from a "parent" proof class... 


 - symmetric points/compressed points
 - Range/bullet proofs?



NOTES: 
- EquivilanceOrLog is not used but built it anyways 
- VerifyZeroSumCommitments is not necessary anymore, removed it comepletely
- DO NOT CHECK PROOF THAT HAS NOT BEEN FILLED IN, do initial checks with the status booleans
